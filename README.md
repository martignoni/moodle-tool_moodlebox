A Moodle administration plugin providing a GUI to some settings and management of a [MoodleBox](https://moodlebox.net/), a Moodle server installed on a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/).

This plugin enables a Moodle administrator to monitor some hardware settings, to set the date of the MoodleBox, to allow restart and shutdown of the MoodleBox and changing Raspberry Pi passwords using a GUI. After the installation in Moodle, some steps are required to complete on the Raspberry Pi (see below).

The plugin is compatible with Moodle 3.1 or later.

## Installation

The MoodleBox plugin must be installed in the Moodle tree of the MoodleBox, in the _tool_ folder. Once installed, an new option _MoodleBox_ will be available in Moodle, under _Site administration > Server_ in the _Administration_ block.

To complete the installation, you have to create some files in the plugin folder and configure some incron jobs on the MoodleBox.

1. Create necessary files
    ```bash
    cd /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/moodlebox
    touch .reboot-server; touch .shutdown-server; touch .set-server-datetime; touch .newpassword; touch .wifisettings
    chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/moodlebox
    ```

1. Install `incron` package and allow `root` to run it:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install incron
    echo root | sudo tee -a /etc/incron.allow
    ```

1. Add following lines to `incrontab`:
    ```bash
    /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/moodlebox/.reboot-server IN_CLOSE_WRITE /sbin/shutdown -r now
    /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/moodlebox/.shutdown-server IN_CLOSE_WRITE /sbin/shutdown -h now
    /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/moodlebox/.set-server-datetime IN_CLOSE_WRITE /bin/bash /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/moodlebox/.set-server-datetime
